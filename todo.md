## Implementation Guidelines

### Development Process
1. **TDD Approach:** Write tests before implementation for all components
2. **Incremental Builds:** Each issue builds on previous work
3. **No Big Jumps:** Complexity increases gradually 
4. **Integration Focus:** All code must integrate with previous steps

### Quality Gates
- [ ] Unit tests passing for all new code
- [ ] Integration tests for Firebase interactions
- [ ] Code review and approval
- [ ] No hanging/orphaned code

### Success Criteria for Phase 0
- [ ] Flutter app runs on iOS/Android simulators
- [ ] Firebase project configured and accessible
- [ ] Market data pipeline fetching real data
- [ ] Basic scoring calculations working
- [ ] All tests passing

---

## Risk Tracking

### Current Risks
- **Low Risk:** All issues have detailed prompts and acceptance criteria
- **Medium Risk:** External API rate limits need monitoring
- **Low Risk:** Firebase quotas for development usage

### Mitigation Strategies
- Start with test data before connecting external APIs
- Monitor API usage from day 1
- Set up proper error handling and fallbacks

## Resource Allocation

### Required Skills per Phase
- **Phase 0:** Flutter, Firebase, Cloud Functions, API integration
- **Phase 1:** UI/UX, Real-time systems, Authentication
- **Phase 2:** Social features, Notifications, Advanced scoring
- **Phase 3:** Performance optimization, App store preparation

### Estimated Effort
- **Phase 0:** 2 developer-weeks (Foundation)
- **Phase 1:** 4 developer-weeks (Core features)  
- **Phase 2:** 6 developer-weeks (Enhanced features)
- **Phase 3:** 6 developer-weeks (Polish & Launch)
